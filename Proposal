# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Owl Banking 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A simple banking program where the user can deposit money,withdraw, etc... with this use of tkinter GUI.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will try to replicate a mobile banking app that the user can play around with. The user will have to first sign up for an account before they can do anything like depositing money. I use tkinter to be able to make the buttons and have that kinda mobile feeling to it. The project will have all sorts of little things to make it feel realistic like needing a secure password and making sure the user is who it is before withdrawling money.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will make sure I do have a GUI with buttons that work when clicked on.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Making sure all the little features to make the app feel "realistic" is made

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

It looks very clean and actully looks like something someone would download on thier phone and use.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to make sure the vertifcation for withdrawling is polished and I would like to dig deeper into the tkinter GUI and be able to make it look aesthetically pleasing and properlly function. I will focus on making it function properlly before focusing on looks but I would love to devlop more skills in GUI to  make my poject not look like it came out in 1990.
